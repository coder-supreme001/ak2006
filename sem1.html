    </h1>
    <p>Began on 24<sup>th</sup> August 2025,we were made busy to the compulsory four days <bold>INDUCTION PROGRAMME.
        </bold>Our curiosity turned into boredom on the fourth day.But still the eagerness of exploring the campus made
        me have some curiosity left.On the first lecture day,teachers introduced themselves in their corresponding hours
        and seemed to be very frank and approaching but they too had warned about the future acceleration for the
        completion of the syllabus. </p><br><br>
    <p>Although we were now adapted to the rajdhani express,we had enough strength to focus on other activities and exploring things.Though,it was the first month but we were able to spot some 1<sup>st</sup> year couples.A semester is expected to be of 6 months but this new story ended in about 3 and a half months.</p><br>
    <p>Talking about myself,I had visited the <a href="https://junctionmall.in/">JUNCTION MALL</a>(eventhough we were restricted).This required just a 2 minutes grasped confidence of being a senior to just walk away from the main gate.I had made some good friends,who are helpful(sometimes).</p><br>
    <p>Walking towards the 2<sup>nd</sup> semester i take a pledge to work on my mistakes,find their solutions and enter the new year with a bucket full of targets of which achieved are to be some.</p><br>
    <p>In the end your effort matters to you,not the accompalishment of targets.</p>
