<p>Now being 19 years old I&apos;m aspiring to be a good web developer with integrated <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI</a>.
    Dreams include winning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">Hackathon</a>,intern for good and valuing
    companies.Living in my state <u>JHARKHAND</u>, we have many idols belonging to this origin like our
    &quot;THALA&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni">M.S. DHONI</a>.I admire him the most and aim to
    be as cool and smart as him with a good grasp of real-time decision.</p>
<p>Talking about my childhood,have been a lineant and go-with-the-flow child not so much intellectual so to be admitted
    to coachings to crack entrance exams to take admission at prestigious institutes.Glad my parents weren&apos;t aware
    about this.My deeds include playing cricket(unbeatble),cycling,badminton,carrom board,chess. </p>
<p>Having taken a residence in the LOCKDOWN I&apos;ve been the bad to worst for myself,still pretending to be good to
    myself(common).Cheated,but tried a new creative thing- gaming alongwith creating videos and publishing videos
    related to it and have gained a reach of around 350 subscribers.</p>
<p>The creativity which once was acquired for fun is now to be enculcated with igniting,inspiring and different ideas but in a different field because i don&apos;t play games now.EARNING is a neccessity but following PASSION acquired with CREATIVITY is also the same-EARNING, even in a more profitable way.</p>
